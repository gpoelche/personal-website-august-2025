                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>Greetings, my name is George. I’m a Pittsburgh-based Full-Stack Development student at Arizona State University. I enjoy creating experiences on the web that are accessible, clean in design and enjoyable in use. I have a strong interest in the development of web apps, tools or entertainment experiences.</p>
                <p>I am also currently a lab technician at the Bodega Film Lab, Pittsburgh’s greatest resource for film development. My responsibilities range from developing all black and white film in-house by hand, machine maintenance and upkeep, film scanning and color correction, as well as community event planning.</p>

                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <p>Film photography has become an essential source of creative expression in my life for the past three years. I began shooting on a secondhand Minolta SRT 201 capturing photos of my life in Pittsburgh in 2023, primarily in black and white. Street photography is a major focus within my work, but I have become more explorative of more subjects over time. I now shoot mostly medium format with my Mamiya 645, balanced more evenly with both color and black and white. </p>

                <h2>Blog</h2>
                <p>Writing is an infrequent, but important medium that I use to connect with myself and others. I tend to write on subjects loosely, ranging from personal projects and technical feats to personal life updates and my thoughts on media I enjoy.</p>
