                <h2>Photography</h2>
                <p>Taking photos is one of my greatest passions and hobbies. I primarily shoot film photography and capture various subjects such as street, nature/landscape, portraiture and more. 
                    You can take a deeper dive at some of the collection of photos I've taken.
